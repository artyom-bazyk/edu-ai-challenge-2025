# Service Analysis Report

## Brief History
The concept of operating systems (OS) for home users dates back to the early 1980s with the advent of personal computers. Key milestones include the release of Microsoft Windows 1.0 in 1985, Apple’s Macintosh System Software in 1984, and the popularization of Linux distributions for desktop use in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Over the decades, operating systems for home users have evolved to support graphical 
user interfaces, multimedia capabilities, internet connectivity, and integration with mobile and cloud services.

## Target Audience
The primary user segments for home user operating systems include:
- Individual consumers using PCs, laptops, or home servers.
- Families managing shared computers for education, entertainment, and communication.
- Students requiring a platform for learning and productivity.
