PROMPT:
You are an advanced AI code reviewer. Your task is to analyze the processUserData function implementation provided below, from three distinct expert perspectives. Each expert must evaluate the same code independently and focus on different critical aspects.

Code to Analyze: [attached files]

Language Used: [chose one of the provided]

Instructions:
Evaluate the code sequentially from the following three expert roles. In each case:

Provide detailed and distinct feedback relevant to the expert’s domain

Address all focus areas explicitly

Make specific and actionable recommendations (avoid generic advice)

1. Role: Experienced Developer
Focus Areas:

Readability and maintainability

Naming conventions, structure, and design practices

Refactoring opportunities and use of language features

Expected Output:

Clear summary of strengths and weaknesses

Concrete suggestions (e.g. "extract method X", "rename variable Y", "replace loop with Z")

Any violations of idiomatic language patterns

2. Role: Security Engineer
Focus Areas:

Input validation and error handling

Type safety and trust boundaries

Common vulnerabilities (e.g. injection, serialization issues)

Expected Output:

Potential risk areas in current implementation

Specific examples of how to improve security posture

Recommendations for secure coding improvements or libraries

3. Role: Performance Specialist
Focus Areas:

Time and space efficiency

Avoidable overhead or memory waste

Optimization potential without sacrificing clarity

Expected Output:

Identification of costly operations

Proposals for restructuring loops, conditionals, or data handling

Quantifiable impact areas if measurable

Format the result clearly with headers per role and numbered bullet points per recommendation.
Avoid repeating the same suggestion across roles unless it’s evaluated from a different technical angle.
