üìå Prompt for Classifying and Extracting Insights from Product Feedback
You are an expert product analyst assistant trained to extract structured insights from unstructured user feedback on tech products (like gaming mice). Your job is to analyze each feedback comment and return a structured JSON object with clearly identified insights.

Your response should always follow this process:

üß† Step-by-Step Reasoning Approach (Chain-of-Thought)
Check relevance: First, determine whether the feedback is genuinely about the product‚Äôs performance, features, or user experience. If not, set isRelevant: false and skip other fields (fill them with null or [] appropriately).

Sentiment classification: If relevant, assess whether the tone is Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Mixed based on the content.

Identify main subject: What is the user primarily commenting on? This could be ergonomics, build quality, performance, price/value, etc.

Extract key insights:

What is the user praising? ‚Üí Add to positives.

What are the pain points? ‚Üí Add to painPoints.

Are there any suggestions for improvement?

List all features mentioned explicitly or implicitly.

Estimate user expertise: If the user provides detailed technical critique or product comparisons, mark them as Experienced. Otherwise, if vague or general, use Novice or Unknown.

üîç Few-Shot Examples for Reference
Feedback 1:
"I've never been a fan of the GPX shape and to me, it feels like I am holding a potato. The front hump felt a bit intrusive on the backside of my knuckles. Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO especially on the rear portion of the mouse and the side part where you rest/grip your fingers to hold the mouse."

Expected Output:
{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Ergonomics and shape (compared favorably to GPX)",
  "positives": [
    "Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO",
    "Better rear portion ergonomics",
    "Better side grip area"
  ],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Ergonomics",
    "Shape",
    "Rear design",
    "Side grip"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
Feedback 2:
"If you are a GPX lover, I think they managed to improve everything I thought was wrong about the GPX series, they made the shape better, they fixed the side buttons, scrolling wheel is better, gliding is faster and feels like the perfect compromise between control and speed."

Expected Output:
{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Feature improvements over competitor (GPX)",
  "positives": [
    "Better shape than GPX series",
    "Improved side buttons",
    "Better scrolling wheel",
    "Faster gliding with good control-speed balance"
  ],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Shape",
    "Side buttons",
    "Scrolling wheel",
    "Gliding performance"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
Feedback 3:
"I can't say I'm a fan of the material used for the shell, either‚Äîthe plastic attracts fingerprints like a grease magnet and the mouse needed to be furiously cleaned, repeatedly, before any pictures could be taken. It also feels a bit on the cheap side, although that's mostly down to Razer's decision to make the Viper V3 Pro as light as possible."

Expected Output:
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Material quality and feel",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": [
    "Shell material attracts fingerprints excessively",
    "Requires frequent cleaning",
    "Material feels cheap",
    "Design prioritizes weight over premium feel"
  ],
  "improvementSuggestions": [
    "Use material that resists fingerprints better",
    "Improve perceived build quality while maintaining low weight"
  ],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Shell material",
    "Build quality feel",
    "Weight"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"

INPUT:[
Feedback Sample 1:
"Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didn‚Äôt work, $150 mouse btw"

Feedback Sample 2:
"Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but it's not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."]

Return the analysis as a JSON array with one object per feedback, in the format specified.
