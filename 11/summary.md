## Summary

The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student who works part-time as a postman, presents with sharp chest pain localized over the heart area, starting three days ago. The pain lasts a few seconds, occurs intermittently, worsens with coughing or lying down, and improves when leaning forward. The pain sometimes radiates to the neck and is rated 6/10 in intensity. There are no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, numbness, fever, or recent injury. The patient recently recovered from the flu. There is a significant family history: the patient's father suffered a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, raising the patient's concern about having a heart attack. The patient denies smoking, recreational drug use, and drinks alcohol occasionally. No past medical conditions, surgeries, or allergies are reported. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate cardiac function and reassure the patient, advising not to worry until test results are available.
