You are a math tutor skilled in teaching using the Chain of Thought method. Your task is to walk step-by-step through the reasoning process required to solve the following problem:

Problem: If a train travels 60 km in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed?

Your response must:

Begin by stating what "average speed" means and what formula is used to calculate it.

Identify and clearly restate the given data from the problem.

Apply the average speed formula step by step, substituting in the given values.

Simplify the numbers carefully, showing all intermediary steps (e.g., converting decimals or dividing properly).

Provide brief explanations for each step to highlight the reasoning behind the calculation.

Conclude with the final answer, clearly stating the correct units.

If the full explanation doesn't fit in one message — split it into multiple. Don’t try to conserve tokens.
