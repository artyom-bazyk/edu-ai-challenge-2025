Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step using the Chain of Thought method.

Step 1: Understand What “Average Speed” Means
Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken to travel that distance.

The formula is:

Average Speed
=
Total Distance
Total Time
Average Speed= 
Total Time
Total Distance
​
 
This tells us how fast something is moving on average over a period of time.

Step 2: Identify the Given Data
From the problem, we are told:

Total Distance = 60 kilometers

Total Time = 1.5 hours

So, we will use these values in the average speed formula.

Step 3: Apply the Formula
Average Speed
=
60
 km
1.5
 hours
Average Speed= 
1.5 hours
60 km
​
 
Now we need to simplify this fraction.

Step 4: Simplify the Division
Dividing by a decimal can be tricky, so let's make the denominator a whole number to make things easier.

We multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10:

60
1.5
=
60
×
10
1.5
×
10
=
600
15
1.5
60
​
 = 
1.5×10
60×10
​
 = 
15
600
​
 
Now divide 600 by 15:

15 goes into 60 four times (15 × 4 = 60), and

15 goes into 600 exactly 40 times.

600
15
=
40
15
600
​
 =40
Step 5: State the Final Answer
So, the average speed of the train is:

40
 km/h
40 km/h
​
 
This means the train was traveling, on average, 40 kilometers per hour.
